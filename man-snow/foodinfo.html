            Great choice 😋 — Biryani is one of the most flavorful and loved dishes in South Asia. I’ll explain it in **simple step-by-step style** (like a recipe guide).

## 🍲 How to Prepare Biryani (Chicken Biryani Example)

### Ingredients

(For about 4 people)

* **Chicken** – 500 g (cut into medium pieces)
* **Basmati rice** – 2 cups (soaked 30 min)
* **Onions** – 3 large (thinly sliced)
* **Tomatoes** – 2 medium (chopped)
* **Curd/Yogurt** – ½ cup
* **Ginger-garlic paste** – 2 tbsp
* **Green chilies** – 3–4 (slit)
* **Mint leaves** – ½ cup
* **Coriander leaves** – ½ cup
* **Whole spices** – 2 bay leaves, 4 cloves, 2 cardamom, 1 inch cinnamon stick, 1 star anise
* **Biryani masala** – 2 tbsp (or garam masala + red chili powder + coriander powder mix)
* **Oil + Ghee** – 3–4 tbsp
* **Salt** – as needed
* **Saffron milk** (optional) – a pinch of saffron soaked in warm milk

---

### Step 1: Cook Rice (70% done)

1. Boil 5 cups of water with salt and a few whole spices.
2. Add soaked basmati rice.
3. Cook until rice is 70% cooked (grains still firm).
4. Drain and set aside.

---

### Step 2: Prepare Chicken Masala

1. Heat oil + ghee in a heavy pot.
2. Fry onions until golden brown → keep some aside for garnish.
3. Add ginger-garlic paste and green chilies → sauté.
4. Add tomatoes, yogurt, and biryani masala → cook until oil separates.
5. Add chicken pieces → cook until 80% done.
6. Add mint + coriander leaves.

---

### Step 3: Layering

1. In the same pot (or handi), keep the chicken masala at the bottom.
2. Spread half the cooked rice over it.
3. Sprinkle fried onions, mint, saffron milk (if using).
4. Add the remaining rice and garnish again.
5. Drizzle 1 tsp ghee on top.

---

### Step 4: Dum Cooking

* Seal the pot with a tight lid (or dough for authentic dum).
* Cook on **low flame** for 20–25 minutes.
* Let it rest for 10 minutes before serving.

---

### Step 5: Serve

* Gently fluff up layers with a flat spoon.
* Serve hot with **raita (yogurt + cucumber/onion)** and salad.

---

👉 That’s the classic **Hyderabadi-style Chicken Biryani**.
It works the same with **mutton, fish, or even vegetables** — just adjust cooking time.

Do you want me to also explain a **shortcut/easy pressure cooker method** for biryani (for busy days), or only the traditional dum style?
